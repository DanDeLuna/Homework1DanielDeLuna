*This is my 2nd repo since my first repo was giving me errors whencdoing git pulls and when I would launch my page it would use my read me file instead of the html file. I will link both repos for the HW assignment* 
# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
This is my second Repo

## Description 
Part of learning and understanding code is learning to de some de bugging and making your code look nice. For this case a marketing agency reached out for us to help debug their webpage.

## User Story
*this was pulled from the module 1 challenge HW file to guide me on this project*
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria
*this was also pulled from the module 1 challenge HW file to guide me on this project*
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
